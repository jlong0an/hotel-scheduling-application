I would use Microsoft Azure as my cloud platform. I would begin by establishing an Azure Container Registry to store my docker image. Second I would make the image of my multithreaded Spring web application and pushing it into the registry. With the image securely stored in the Azure Container Registry, I'd proceed to create an Azure Container Instance. Then I would deploy the Azure Container Instance which will launch my application to make it live.
